                                         FOR LOOP

1.Whenever we want to print an array element, we use for loop.
2.whenever we want to print the code repeatedly.
3. Whenever we want to implement a codes, which is to be updated after every iteration, we use for loop.We use the property of update in index after every iteration.
4. for loop has a property, because of which the index gets updated after every iteration.
E.g:-
printing for loop.
Iteration means one cycle of for loop before update of i.
We can customize our own update algorithm i.e Update in value of i.


        BREAK AND CONTINUE STATEMENT

Break statement=> instantly terminates the for loop and come outside of it.
Continue Statement=> Continue statement instantly sends code control to next update.
continue terminates the whole for loop, but continue terminates the present iteration.


     FOR OF LOOP

1. For of loop is a special kind of loop which is used specially in case of array or similar data type.

2. A similar kind of short for of loop can be achieved to do the same task.
